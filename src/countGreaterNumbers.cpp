/*
OVERVIEW: You are given a bank statement where transactions are ordered by date. Write a function that finds the number of transactions in that statement after a given date.
-- find the count of numbers greater than a given number in a sorted array.
E.g.: Input: A[3] = { { 10, "09-10-2003", "First" }, { 20, "19-10-2004", "Second" }, { 30, "03-03-2005", "Third" } };
date = "19-10-2004"
Output: 1 (as there is only one transaction { 30, "03-03-2005", "Third" })

INPUTS: One bank statement (array of transactions) and date.

OUTPUT: Return the number of transactions in that statement after a given date.

ERROR CASES: Return NULL for invalid inputs.
